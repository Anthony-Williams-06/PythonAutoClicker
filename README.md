# PythonAutoClicker
A basic left and right click autoclicker with adjustable speed in a text-based ui

How to use:
When the program starts, you will need to enter a delay time (in secconds) of how frequently to click.
'0.001' secconds is very fast.
Pressing the '1' key toggles left click, and pressing the '2' key toggles right click.
Pressing the grave accent key (won't show properly because of how README.md file gets handled by github) stops the program.
