# PythonAutoClicker
A basic left and right click autoclicker with adjustable speed in a text-based ui

How to use:

When the program starts, you will need to enter the number of clicks per seccond the program will make.
Pressing the '1' key toggles left click, and pressing the '2' key toggles right click.
Pressing the '3' key stops both left and right clicking.
Pressing the grave accent key (won't show properly because of how README.md file gets handled by github) stops the program.
